   <h3>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially designed by
    Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. 
    It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers 
    to express concepts in fewer lines of code. Python 
    is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</h3>

    <h3 id="handwritten-digit-recognition">test1</h3>
    <p>This is my own project using image recognition methods in practice. This is a site (also works on mobile) where user can draw a digit, and machine learning models (FNN and CNN) will try to recognize it. After than models can use the drawn digit for training to improve their accuracy. Live version is <a href="https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/digit-draw-recognize">here</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="chatbot-in-telegram">test2</h3>
    <p>A conversational chatbot in <a href="http://t.me/amlnlpbot">telegram</a> which was created for an honor assignment of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing/home/welcome">nlp course by Higher School of Economics</a>. The main functionality of the bot is to distinguish two types of questions (questions related to programming and others) and then either give an answer or talk using a conversational model.</p>
